# Deep Learning: Behavioral Cloning

In this project, I host all software I've written by hand to train a deep learning neural network to drive a car around a test track AND a never-before-seen track. The latter track demonstrates how well my network modeling generalizes to unseen roadways and conditions. This is going to be epic. Stay tuned!
